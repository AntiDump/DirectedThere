# DirectedThere

DirectedThere is a advanced open-source fuzzer coded in vb.net.

This program is a open-source program which mean you have all the rights to
edit the code and stuff, but that doesnt mean you can claim the program as
your, if you want too use some code make sure to credit me in the code,
else your a skid and probably have no coding experience, I have worked really
hard on this program for it too be free, and so the lease you can do is credit
me, that isn't hard at all.

DirectedThere is a easy to use and gui-friendly, with our minimalistic looks
and with its outstanding theme from Material_Skin.dll, makes it looks amazing
Credits too the owner that made Material_Skin.dll.

If you find any bug in the program please contact me via disord, cause I will
be sure to fix them, Ik theres a error on start but Im working on finding it
out and I hope you guys enjoy DirectedThere, cause I sure use it alot.
